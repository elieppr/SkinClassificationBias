# SkinClassificationBias

Abstractâ€”The introduction of artificial intelligence into healthcare has significantly increased diagnosis rates, reduced diagnosis
times, and expanded treatment options. However, the employment
of AI in disease diagnosis has sparked concerns about its capability to diagnose accurately and fairly for marginalized groups that
are underrepresented in datasets. A worrisome example is the
discrepancy in skin cancer diagnosis accuracies between patients
with darker and lighter skin tones. In this study, we employ the
Kruskal-Wallis hypothesis test to quantify biases that may arise
during AI model training and assess various strategies to mitigate
them. We find that augmentations tailored to address the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in datasets could significantly
alleviate bias in AI models. Additionally, our investigation unveils
notable variations in the effectiveness of different augmentation
techniques in reducing bias, with Color Jitter emerging as a
standout augmentation technique that can effectively mitigate
bias. Furthermore, our analysis of the interplay between light and
dark skin images during training underscores the importance of
incorporating diverse skin tones in the training process to narrow
the accuracy gap and mitigate bias across different skin colors.
